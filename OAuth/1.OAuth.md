# OAuth
- Authorization framework


## OAuth Terminologies
- Resource Owner
  - User who owns the resources
  - Eg. Facebook User
- Client
  - 3rd party Application which is  tryting to access Users Resources.
  - Eg. Some kind of dating app which need access to your photos on FB.
- Resource Server
  - A server where user has its resources.

- Authorization Server
  - Eg. FB's Authorization server.(OAuth Server) 
- Authorization Grant
  - An authorization grant is a credential representing the resource ownerâ€™s authorization (to access its protected resources) used by the client to obtain an access token. The OAuth specification defines four grant types, which we will discuss in the upcoming lessons.  
- Authorization code
  -  In some OAuth flows, the authorization server does not give the access token directly. It first issues an authorization grant. The client then sends this grant with the client secret (more on this later) to the authorization server. After this, the authorization server gives access token to the client. 
- Access Token
  - Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources. An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.
